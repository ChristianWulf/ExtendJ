/*
The point of this construction is only to force the JastAddParser to create a Terminal
for the UNDERSCORE reserved keyword. WILLFAIL is a Terminal that is never returned from
the scanner, and thus this construction will never actually parse. The reason it is done like
this is because no way was found to add terminals not used in any production, since the 
JastAddParser automatically finds and lists all terminals from the grammar.
